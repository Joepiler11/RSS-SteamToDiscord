# RSS-SteamToDiscord

This project runs a simple powershell script to pull and parse RSS data from the Steam News Hub and posts then to discord channels via webhooks.  

The script runs every 5 minutes.  

You can run this with docker or you can find the .ps1 in the "Build" folder.  

The docker image is a linux base running powershell core (mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:latest)  

* May work with other RSS feeds but not guaranteed.
